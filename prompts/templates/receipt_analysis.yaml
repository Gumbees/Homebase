- description: Brief description of purchase
- due_date: Due date if this is a bill (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- is_bill: true if this is an unpaid bill, false if it's a paid receipt

LINE ITEMS:
For each item purchased, extract:
- description: Item name/description
- quantity: Number of items (default 1.0)
- unit_price: Price per unit
- total_price: Total price for this line item
- category: Use existing categories when possible, suggest NEW ones if needed
- object_type: Choose from available object types or suggest 'person' if this references a person
- create_object: true if this item should become an inventory object
- confidence: Your confidence in this classification (0.0-1.0)

PEOPLE DETECTION (CRITICAL):
Always look for and extract people mentioned in receipts:
- Names of customers, staff, attendees, or contacts
- Look in: customer names, staff signatures, attendee lists, contact info
- For each person found, include in people_found array:
  - person_name: Full name
  - role: customer, staff, attendee, contact, etc.
  - relationship_to_purchase: how they relate to this transaction
  - create_person_object: true to create a person object
  - confidence: your confidence in detection

EVENT DETECTION:
For event-related purchases (tickets, admissions, festivals):
- Extract event details: name, date, venue, seat info
- Look for QR codes, confirmation codes, ticket numbers
- Include in digital_assets and event_details sections

CATEGORIZATION GUIDELINES:
- Use existing categories when they fit
- Suggest NEW categories when existing ones don't match
- Be specific but not overly granular
- Consider cross-system usage (financial, inventory, etc.)

CONFIDENCE:
Provide a confidence score (0.0-1.0) for the overall extraction accuracy.

Return the data as valid JSON matching the receipt_data schema."
