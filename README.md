## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/homebase.git
   cd homebase
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp stack.env.example stack.env
   # Edit stack.env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # OR using uv (recommended)
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Run with Docker (recommended)**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Or run locally**
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL database
   # Configure DATABASE_URL in stack.env
   python app.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

All configuration is done through the `stack.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | Yes | - |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Flask session secret key | No | `development_secret_key` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for GPT models | No | - |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key for Claude models | No | - |
| `LLM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT` | Local LLM Studio endpoint | No | `http://localhost:1234` |

### AI Provider Configuration

Homebase supports multiple AI providers:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 Vision for receipt and image analysis
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Claude-3.5 Sonnet for enhanced analysis
- **LLM Studio**: Local models for privacy-focused processing

Configure your preferred provider in the application settings after first run.

## üì± Usage

### Adding Receipts
1. Navigate to **Receipt Upload**
2. Upload your receipt (JPG, PNG, or PDF)
3. Choose your AI model (Claude recommended)
4. Review the extracted data and line items
5. Optionally create inventory objects from line items

### Managing Inventory
1. Go to **Inventory** to view all objects
2. Click **Add Object** to manually add items
3. Upload photos for AI analysis
4. Set categories, depreciation, and relationships

### Viewing Reports
- **Receipts**: View all processed receipts and invoices
- **Bills**: Track unpaid bills with due dates
- **Reminders**: Manage shopping lists and maintenance tasks

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Objects**: Central table for all tracked items (assets, consumables, etc.)
- **Invoices & Line Items**: Financial transaction records
- **Attachments**: Binary storage for receipts and photos
- **Categories**: Hierarchical organization system
- **AI Queue**: Managed processing queue for AI operations

### AI Processing Pipeline
