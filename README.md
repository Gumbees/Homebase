## üèóÔ∏è Data Model

Homebase uses a clear conceptual framework that separates **Entities** (informational/administrative records) from **Objects** (physical/tangible items). This design makes the system intuitive for developers and users alike.

### üìã Entities
**Entities** are informational records that document, manage, or organize Objects. They exist in the digital/administrative realm and represent processes, documentation, or metadata.

| Entity Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Invoices** | Financial transaction records | Receipt from Best Buy documenting laptop purchase |
| **Organizations** | Business relationship management | Best Buy Inc., Local Plumbing Services, Amazon.com |
| **Users** | System access and digital identity | User accounts, login profiles, system permissions |
| **Notes** | Documentation and comments | Maintenance notes for office equipment |
| **Tasks** | Work items and to-dos | "Schedule annual equipment inspection" |
| **Calendar Appointments** | Scheduled events | Maintenance appointment for HVAC system |
| **Collections** | Grouped sets of objects | "Office Equipment", "Kitchen Appliances" |
| **Actions** | Historical activity records | "Moved printer from Office A to Office B" |

### üéØ Objects
**Objects** are physical, tangible items that exist in the real world. These are the actual things you can touch, use, or store.

| Object Type | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Assets** | High-value, durable items | Laptops, furniture, vehicles, equipment |
| **Consumables** | Items that get used up | Office supplies, food, cleaning products |
| **Components** | Parts of larger assets | RAM modules, replacement parts, accessories |
| **People** | Individuals in your system | Family members, employees, contacts |
| **Pets** | Animals under your care | Dogs, cats, fish, birds |
| **Services** | Ongoing service contracts | Software subscriptions, maintenance contracts |
| **Software** | Digital tools and licenses | Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite |

### üîó Entity-Object Relationships

Entities and Objects are connected through meaningful relationships:

```
üìÑ Invoice (Entity) ‚îÄ‚îÄdocuments‚îÄ‚îÄ> üíª Laptop (Asset Object)
                   ‚îî‚îÄdocuments‚îÄ‚îÄ> üñ±Ô∏è Mouse (Component Object)

üè¢ Organization (Entity) ‚îÄ‚îÄemploys‚îÄ‚îÄ> üßë Contact Person (People Object)
                        ‚îî‚îÄprovides‚îÄ‚îÄ> üõçÔ∏è Services (Service Objects)
                        ‚îî‚îÄsells‚îÄ‚îÄ> üì¶ Products (Asset/Consumable Objects)

üë§ User (Entity) ‚îÄ‚îÄrepresents‚îÄ‚îÄ> üßë Person (People Object)
                 ‚îî‚îÄcreates‚îÄ‚îÄ> üìÑ Invoices (Entity)
                 ‚îî‚îÄmanages‚îÄ‚îÄ> üìù Tasks (Entity)

üìù Task (Entity) ‚îÄ‚îÄmanages‚îÄ‚îÄ> üìé Office Supplies (Consumable Objects)

üìÅ Collection (Entity) ‚îÄ‚îÄgroups‚îÄ‚îÄ> {üñ•Ô∏è Monitor, ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard, üñ±Ô∏è Mouse}

üìÖ Calendar Event (Entity) ‚îÄ‚îÄschedules‚îÄ‚îÄ> üöó Vehicle Maintenance (Asset Object)

üè¢ Organization (Entity) ‚îÄ‚îÄdocumented_in‚îÄ‚îÄ> üìÑ Invoice (Entity)
                        ‚îî‚îÄcontracted_for‚îÄ‚îÄ> üîß Service Agreement (Service Object)
```

### üíæ Database Implementation

The current implementation uses these primary tables:

**Entity Tables:**
- **`invoices`** - Financial transaction records
- **`organizations`** - Business relationships and vendor management
- **`users`** - System access, profiles, and digital identity
- **`task_queue`** - Background processing and workflow management
- **`calendar_events`** - Scheduled appointments and maintenance
- **`collections`** - Grouped object sets and organization
- **`notes`** - Documentation and comments

**Object Tables:**
- **`objects`** - Central table for all physical items
- **`categories`** - Organization system for objects

**Relationship Tables:**
- **`invoice_line_items`** - Links invoices to specific purchased objects
- **`attachments`** - Photos and documents for both entities and objects
- **`ai_evaluation_queue`** - AI analysis queue for objects
- **`organization_contacts`** - Links organizations to people objects
- **`user_person_mapping`** - Links users to their corresponding people objects
- **`receipt_creation_tracking`** - Tracks what was created from each receipt

### üéõÔ∏è Receipt Creation Tracking System

Homebase includes a sophisticated system for tracking what gets created from receipts:

**Key Concepts:**
- `creation_type`: What type was created (`'object'`, `'invoice'`, `'organization'`, `'calendar_event'`)
- `creation_id`: The primary key of the created record (regardless of table)
- `line_item_index`: Which receipt line item created it (null for receipt-level items)

**Features:**
- **üéØ Selective Creation**: Use checkboxes in AI Queue to choose what gets created
- **üõ°Ô∏è Duplicate Prevention**: Never create the same thing twice from one receipt
- **üìç Granular Tracking**: Line-item level tracking for objects, receipt-level for entities
- **üß† Smart UI**: Hide creation options on Receipts page once items are already created

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Object created from line item 0
creation_type='object', creation_id=123, line_item_index=0

-- Calendar event created from receipt
creation_type='calendar_event', creation_id=456, line_item_index=NULL

-- Organization created from vendor
creation_type='organization', creation_id=789, line_item_index=NULL
```

### üéØ Design Benefits

1. **Clear Mental Model**: Developers immediately understand what documents vs. manages
2. **Flexible Relationships**: One invoice can document multiple objects; one task can manage multiple consumables
3. **Logical Queries**: "Show me all objects documented by this invoice" vs. "Show me all tasks managing these consumables"
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new entity types (Reports, Contracts) or object types (Tools, Plants)
5. **Real-World Mapping**: Structure matches how people naturally think about belongings and documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Problems

### Critical Issues
- **Calendar Page**: The calendar page loads indefinitely and is not functional. This affects event viewing and calendar-based features.

### UI Issues
- **Modal Backdrop Stuck**: After viewing object/entity details in modal windows and closing them, the screen sometimes remains with a transparent gray overlay and becomes unclickable. This affects object details modals throughout the application.

### Workarounds
- **Calendar**: Use the AI Queue and Receipts pages for event management until calendar functionality is restored. Events can still be created through receipt processing but cannot be viewed in calendar format.
- **Modal Backdrop**: If the screen becomes unclickable after closing a modal, refresh the page (F5) to restore functionality. Alternatively, press the ESC key multiple times to force-close any lingering modal states.
